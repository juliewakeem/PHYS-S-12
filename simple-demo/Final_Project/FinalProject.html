 ### Final Project: Mobility glove

 <h1>Initial Planning</h1>
 <br>
 <h3>Project Overview</h3>
 <p1>My Final Project idea is a mobility glove. This glove would contain a bone structure that can be used as an extension to grab whatever object is infront of it. The purpose of this project is to help with grip disadvantages which is inspired by my grandmother. My view for the plan for this project is to experiment with materials to create the core bone structure then figuring out the coding part that allows the bone structure to do its job. </p1>

 <br>

 <h3>Timeline</h3>
 <p1>This is a rough idea of my timeline plan to get this project completed.</p1>
 <ol>
 <li> Determine the material best fit to use for the bone structure of the glove. </li>
 <li> Figure out ways to model the "extending" piece of the bone structure.</li>
 <li> Create the code for the bone structure/attach to maintain in a self-contained way. </li>
 <li> Attach the bone structure to the glove. </li>
 <li> Test and Determine any errors. </li>
 <li> Change/Modify errors. </li>
 <li> Document Results. </li>
 </ol>
  
 
 
 <h3>Materials</h3>

 <ol>
 <li> Leather Glove - this will serve as the base of the project, the leather will make it easier to apply the bone structure to. </li>
 <li> Arduino - In order to program the bone structure, I believe that I will use the Arduino to create commands for it to be able to move.</li>
 <li> Bone Structure - My first idea in creating this piece of the project is using 3D printed bone structure parts that are able to flex in order to have a structure that is firm yet flexible. </li>
 <li> Sensors - The structure will need some type of sensor to detect that an object is in front of it in order to continue its action. I'm not exactly sure what sensor to use. My guess is perhaps using a temperature sensor since every object has a certain temperature frequency. Then, assigning the code a range of temperature wavelengths that are acceptable to continue its motion.</li>
 <li> Pressure Sensors - In order for the bone structure to recognize that it has something in its hold, it will need pressure sensors to notify that its reached its "target" which is the desired object.</li> 
 </ol>

 <h3>Silicone/Soft Robotics Bone Structure</h3>
 <br>
 <p1>My main idea for creating the bone structure is using soft robotics. This is made out of silicone and flexes when introduced to air. This seemed like a good idea to make a bone structure that flexes without being too complicated. I just needed molds of silicone, syringe, and a tube to create it.</p1>
 <br>
 Here are some images of the process:

 <br><br>

 <br><br>
 <p1>I quickly ran into the problem that the silicone molds weren't tightly sealed and the silicone glue was still sticky despite sitting out for more than 24 hours. I also realized that I needed a bigger syringe to cause more air pressure or the molds won't flex. I wasn't able to find a bigger syringe and no matter how long I leave them, the molds were still sticky on the outside. I was slowly running out of time and decided to make a new bone structure rather continue working on the silicone molds.  </p1>
 <br>
 <h3>Second Bone Structure</h3>
 <br>
 <p1>To make the second bone structure I decided to use 3D printed square and round pieces to mimic joints, and a timing belt to create more flexibility. I wanted to make the bone structure as simple as possible to provide less complications. I added straw pieces to the back to make the structure less flimsy.</p1>
 <br>
 Here are some images of the process and file for the 3D pieces:

 <br><br>

 <br>
 <p1>To make the bone structure flex to hold an object, I used a DC motor with strings. I thought that if I attach the strings from each finger to the motor, the motor would spin and force the strings to spin with it. This would pull on the fingers and make them close.</p1>
 <br>
 <p1>When making this bone structure it was a lot easier to imagine it in the overall design of my project and there were less pieces to worry about. </p1>
 <br>
 <h3>Prototype - Extension part of the Bone Structure</h3>
 <br>
 <p1> One of the first parts I created for this glove is the part that would allow the bone structure to extend forward.</p1>
 <br>
 <br>
 <a href="https://juliewakeem.github.io/PHYS-S-12/simple-demo/010_week10/week10.html">This link will lead to a page that explains the complete process for this prototype. Click Here. </a>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p1>Essentially, I learned in class that the stepper motors could be used to create linear motion. I thought this was very interesting since I needed something that would be able to move back and forth to allow the bone structure to extend forward. Therefore, I used gears to turn the stepper motor's rotating motion into linear motion. The most reaoccuring problem for this part was the friction between the motor and the piece that connected to the gears. To fix this, I used a mechanical shaft coupling and lots of hot glue to secure the pieces together to reduce the amount of friction. This is the part of the design I am most proud of because of how interesting it was to build. I learned a lot from just this part alone.</p1>

 <h3>Code and Circuit</h3>
 <br>
 <p1>For the circuit I used the very basic setup that was introduced in class for the stepper motor as well as a button to control it. I also used the DRV8834 low-voltage stepper driver. As for the DC motor, I used the L9110 motor driver and two buttons to control the direction of the rotating motion. </p1>
 <br>
 Here are images of the circuit:

 <br>
 Here is the code:
 <br>
 <pre><code class="language-arduino">
  const int stepPin = 13;
  const int dirPin = 12;
  const int buttonPin = 26;     // the number of the pushbutton pin;
  const int A1A = 18;  // define pin 18 for A-1A (speed)
  const int A1B = 5;  // define pin 5 for A-1B (direction)
  const int buttonPin1 = 19;     // the number of the pushbutton pin
  const int buttonPin2 = 21;   // the number of the 2nd pushbutton pin
  
  void setup() {
    // put your setup code here, to run once:
    pinMode(stepPin, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(dirPin, OUTPUT);
  
    digitalWrite(stepPin, 0);  // start with the buzzer off 
    pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
    pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT);     // specify these pins as outputs
    pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   // start with the motors off 
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    pinMode(buttonPin1, INPUT_PULLUP);
    pinMode(buttonPin2, INPUT_PULLUP);
  }
  
  void loop() {
    // read the state of the pushbutton value:
        int buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
        // check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
        if (buttonState == LOW) {
          // start the  stepper motor
    // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
         digitalWrite(stepPin, LOW);
        delay(5);
        digitalWrite(stepPin, HIGH);
        delay(5);
        } else {
          // stop the stepper motor
          digitalWrite(stepPin, 0);   //  turns off buzzer when the button is unpressed
        }
    // read the state of the pushbutton value:
        int buttonState1 = digitalRead(buttonPin1);
        int buttonState2 = digitalRead(buttonPin2);
        // check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
        if (buttonState2 == LOW) {
        // start the motor 
          digitalWrite(A1A, HIGH);   
          digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
        } else if (buttonState1 == LOW){
          // stop the motor
          digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   //  turns off motor when the button is unpressed
          digitalWrite(A1B, HIGH);
        } else{
          digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   //  turns off motor when the button is unpressed
          digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
        }
  
  }

 <h3>Putting the pieces on the Glove/Complications</h3>
 <br>
 <p1>After making sure my bone structure and extension pieces work as best as they could, I moved on to attaching those pieces to the glove. A problem that resulted immediately is where to put the motors and giant gears as well as if the glove will be able to hold all the weight of the pieces. I first started by designing an extra piece to the original glove so that there is more material to fit the motors on. I did this by taking another glove and cutting off the finger pieces and attaching it with a thread. I also put velcro on the side so that it is more easily accesible to put the hand through.</p1>
 <br>
 This is what the glove looked like when finished:
 <br>
 ![image of embroidery](FinalProjectimage18.jpg)
 <br>
 <p1> After doing this, I started by putting the stepper motor and gears since they were the heaviest pieces. I used tape to secure them which was a little difficult due to the imbalance of those two pieces. Then I attached the bone structure to the extending stick from the gears. This is where the complications started ocurring. Since I wanted the bone structure to be able to extend forward, this meant that it could not be secured to the glove in any way so it would be able to move. The downside to this was that the weight of the bone structure was all on the gear parts. This messed with the friction connection between the motor and the gears and stopped the gears from spinning. The gears could not handle to pressure of free floating next to the glove while holding the weight of the bone structure so it got stuck whenever the button for the stepper motor was pushed. Unfortunately this was a big problem and could not be solved due to the imbalance of the whole structure. No matter how much support there was to the stepper motor or the gears, they simply were stuck. There was also a problem with the strings and DC motor. THe strings weren't twisting around the DC motor enough to force the fingers down. I believe that if I had more time I would have designed a better way to hold everything on the glove and account for these certain complications before hand.</p1>
 <br>
 Here are some pictures of all the pieces on the glove:
 <br>

 <br>

 <br>
 <p1>As a result of this, I decided to relieve the glove of the pieces and just put them together to create a small robot that can still function in the same way as I wanted it to.</p1>
