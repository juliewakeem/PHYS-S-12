 ### Final Project: Mobility glove

 <h1>Initial Planning</h1>
 <br>
 <br>
 <h3>Project Overview</h3>
 <p1>My Final Project idea is a mobility glove. This glove would contain a bone structure that can be used as an extension to grab whatever object is infront of it. The purpose of this project is to help with grip disadvantages which is inspired by my grandmother. My view for the plan for this project is to experiment with materials to create the core bone structure then figuring out the coding part that allows the bone structure to do its job. </p1>


 <h3>Timeline</h3>
 <p1>This is a rough idea of my timeline plan to get this project completed.</p1>
 <ol>
 <li> Determine the material best fit to use for the bone structure of the glove. </li>
 <li> Figure out ways to model the "extending" piece of the bone structure.</li>
 <li> Create the code for the bone structure/attach to maintain in a self-contained way. </li>
 <li> Attach the bone structure to the glove. </li>
 <li> Test and Determine any errors. </li>
 <li> Change/Modify errors. </li>
 <li> Document Results. </li>
 </ol>
  
 
 
 <h3>Materials</h3>

 <ol>
 <li> Leather Glove - this will serve as the base of the project, the leather will make it easier to apply the bone structure to. </li>
 <li> Arduino - In order to program the bone structure, I believe that I will use the Arduino to create commands for it to be able to move.</li>
 <li> Bone Structure - My first idea in creating this piece of the project is using 3D printed bone structure parts that are able to flex in order to have a structure that is firm yet flexible. </li>
 <li> Sensors - The structure will need some type of sensor to detect that an object is in front of it in order to continue its action. I'm not exactly sure what sensor to use. My guess is perhaps using a temperature sensor since every object has a certain temperature frequency. Then, assigning the code a range of temperature wavelengths that are acceptable to continue its motion.</li>
 <li> Pressure Sensors - In order for the bone structure to recognize that it has something in its hold, it will need pressure sensors to notify that its reached its "target" which is the desired object.</li> 
 </ol>
 

 <h3>Prototype - Extension part of the Bone Structure</h3>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p1> One of the first parts I created for this glove is the part that would allow the bone structure to extend forward.</p1>
