 ### Final Project: Mobility glove

 <h1>Initial Planning</h1>
 <br>
 <h3>Project Overview</h3>
 <p1>My Final Project idea is a mobility glove. This glove would contain a bone structure that can be used as an extension to grab whatever object is infront of it. The purpose of this project is to help with grip disadvantages which is inspired by my grandmother. My view for the plan for this project is to experiment with materials to create the core bone structure then figuring out the coding part that allows the bone structure to do its job. </p1>

 <h3>Timeline</h3>
 <p1>This is a rough idea of my timeline plan to get this project completed.</p1>
 <ol>
 <li> Determine the material best fit to use for the bone structure of the glove. </li>
 <li> Figure out ways to model the "extending" piece of the bone structure.</li>
 <li> Create the code for the bone structure/attach to maintain in a self-contained way. </li>
 <li> Attach the bone structure to the glove. </li>
 <li> Test and Determine any errors. </li>
 <li> Change/Modify errors. </li>
 <li> Document Results. </li>
 </ol>
  
 
 
 <h3>Materials</h3>

 <ol>
 <li> Leather Glove - this will serve as the base of the project, the leather will make it easier to apply the bone structure to. </li>
 <li> Arduino - In order to program the bone structure, I believe that I will use the Arduino to create commands for it to be able to move.</li>
 <li> Bone Structure - My first idea in creating this piece of the project is using 3D printed bone structure parts that are able to flex in order to have a structure that is firm yet flexible. </li>
 <li> Sensors - The structure will need some type of sensor to detect that an object is in front of it in order to continue its action. I'm not exactly sure what sensor to use. My guess is perhaps using a temperature sensor since every object has a certain temperature frequency. Then, assigning the code a range of temperature wavelengths that are acceptable to continue its motion.</li>
 <li> Pressure Sensors - In order for the bone structure to recognize that it has something in its hold, it will need pressure sensors to notify that its reached its "target" which is the desired object.</li> 
 </ol>
 

 <h3>Prototype - Extension part of the Bone Structure</h3>
 <br>
 <p1> One of the first parts I created for this glove is the part that would allow the bone structure to extend forward.</p1>

 <h3>Silicone/Soft Robotics Bone Structure</h3>
 <br>
 <p1>My main idea for creating the bone structure is using soft robotics. This is made out of silicone and flexes when introduced to air. This seemed like a good idea to make a bone structure that flexes without being too complicated. I just needed molds of silicone, syringe, and a tube to create it.</p1>
 <br>
 Here are some images of the process:

 <br><br>
 <p1>I quickly ran into the problem that the silicone molds weren't tightly sealed and the silicone glue was still sticky despite sitting out for more than 24 hours. I also realized that I needed a bigger syringe to cause more air pressure or the molds won't flex. I wasn't able to find a bigger syringe and no matter how long I leave them, the molds were still sticky on the outside. I was slowly running out of time and decided to make a new bone structure rather continue working on the silicone molds.  </p1>
 <br>
 <h3>Second Bone Structure</h3>
 <br>
 <p1>To make the second bone structure I decided to use 3D printed square and round pieces to mimic joints, and a timing belt to create more flexibility. I wanted to make the bone structure as simple as possible to provide less complications. I added straw pieces to the back to make the structure less flimsy.</p1>
