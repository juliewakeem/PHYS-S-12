 ### Week 3: Kinetic Sculpture

 <h1>Aladdin's Magic Flying Carpet</h1>
<p1>For this week's assignment, my first idea to make into a kinetic sculpture was the magic flying carpet from the move Aladdin. After my press fit pyramid, I decided to include a little bit of eygptian influence into my assignments as best I can. Therefore, the magic carpet really fits the theme.</p1>

<p2>I started by thinking how to make a rectanglular shaped carpet more flexible. I noticed a flexible piece of cardboard in the examples box in the lab. I learned that it is called a "living hinge" or cardboard fixture. It is a type of pattern that is made to make the cardboard less rigid.</p2>

Here is my design for the living hinge for my magic carpet.
