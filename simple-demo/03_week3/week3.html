 ### Week 3: Kinetic Sculpture

 <h1>Aladdin's Magic Flying Carpet</h1>
<p1>For this week's assignment, my first idea to make into a kinetic sculpture was the magic flying carpet from the move Aladdin. After my press fit pyramid, I decided to include a little bit of eygptian influence into my assignments as best I can. Therefore, the magic carpet really fits the theme.</p1>

<p2>I started by thinking how to make a rectanglular shaped carpet more flexible. I noticed a flexible piece of cardboard in the examples box in the lab. I learned that it is called a "living hinge" or cardboard fixture. It is a type of pattern that is made to make the cardboard less rigid.</p2>

Here is my design for the living hinge for my magic carpet.

Next, I made rectangle pieces to make the body of the actual part that would manuever the kinetic sculpture.

Then, I made the circles that would spin to create the motion. I also made the wooden stick parts that would be put on top of the circles and attach to the carpet itself.

To assemble all the pieces together, I used a hot glue gun and a drill to create the holes for the wooden sticks.

Next, I needed to make my living hinge more carpet-like. I got leftover fabric from my grandmother and covered the flexible cardboard with it. The blue is so magical!

The final step is to add the carpet to the sculpture body.

For the motor, I made almost a table attached to the sculpture body so that the motor stands on it and can easily access the wooden stick to operate the sculpture. The square bottom is an extra piece from last week's assignment. The "table" is made of squares that are 40 mm by 40 mm and 40 mm diametered circles.

Here is a video of the finished project. Now its finally a magic flying carpet.
