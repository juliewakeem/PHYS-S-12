  ### Week 1: Introduction 
<title>Final Project Proposal</title>
<h1>Mobility Glove</h1>
<p>For the final project, I am thinking of make a glove that is an extension of your hand. I like the idea of a robot arm but one that is more excessable to yourself instead of operated by a remote control. For the glove, it would have a bone structure addition to it that is able to reach out and aquire an object. I think something to do with magnets as well as a sensor could help to identify objects in front of it. </p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>My grandmother once fell on her arm which resulted in less strength when using the arm. She is now less able to do things with that arm. The mobility glove can add extra strength with the built-in bone structure. This allows for an extension for the arm and helps with cases like my grandmother.</p>
