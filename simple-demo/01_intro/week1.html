  ### Week 1: Introduction 
<title>Final Project Proposal</title>
<h1>Mobility Glove</h1>
<p>For the final project, I am thinking of make a glove that is an extension of your hand. I like the idea of a robot arm but one that is more excessable to yourself instead of operated by a remote control. For the glove, it would have a bone structure addition to it that is able to reach out and aquire an object. I think something to do with magnets as well as a sensor could help to identify objects in front of it. </p>
