 ### Week 10: Machine Building - Stepper Motors

 <h1>Final Project Prototype</h1>
 <br>
 For this assignment, I decided to use the stepper motor to create a prototype for the extending part of my project. From class, I learned that stepper motors can be used to create linear motion. I researched a lot of ways to do this and felt that using gears was the best way to do this without overcomplicating the prototype. 
 <br>
 Here is a picture from Fusion 360 and videos from the 3D printing process:

 I used M3 x 10mm screws to secure the pieces together. Here is the finished gear part:

 For the stepper motor, I used the simple circuit from class as well as the very first code since I only needed the stepper motor to rotate normally. 
 <br>
 Here is a picture of the circuit with the gear part:

 Here is the code used for the stepper motor:
 <br>
 <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    const int stepPin = 13;
    const int dirPin = 12;
    
    void setup() {
      // put your setup code here, to run once:
      pinMode(stepPin, OUTPUT);
      pinMode(dirPin, OUTPUT);
    
      digitalWrite(dirPin, LOW);
    }
    
    void loop() {
      // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
      digitalWrite(stepPin, LOW);
      delay(5);
      digitalWrite(stepPin, HIGH);
      delay(5);
    }
 </code></pre>
 <br>
 <br>
 Finally, here is a video of the stepper motor and gear part. The cardboard hand represents the bone structure of my final project. This is to simply demonstrate the extending part of the project. I have learned that the extending part will provide limitations for the whole glove because of the weight of the motor and gear piece. I will definetly look for an alternative solution.

 The way the gear piece is connected to the motor is by a white piece that has a drilled hole that fits the motor. I can detach that piece from the motor and use it as a handle to bring the "hand" back to "home" position (this is the point closest to the gear). Here is a picture of that piece.
