 ### Week 4: Microcontroller Programming

 <h1> Arduino Uno and The Magic Flying Carpet</h1>
 <p1>For this week's assignment I chose to expand on my magic flying carpet. I wanted to make a start/stop button as well as add a potentiometer to control the speed.</p1>

 <p2> The first thing I did was create the code for the start/stop button as well as set it up on the arduino uno.</p2>

 This is how my circuit looks like with just the button.
