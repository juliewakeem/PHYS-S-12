 ### Week 8: CNC Milling, Molding and Casting

 <h1>CNC Milling --> SRM - 20</h1>
 <br>
 For this week's assignment I decided to combine the CNC milling and the molding and Casting parts together. I created a design with books using Fusion 360 since it is one of my favorite hobbies. 
 <br>
 Here is a picture  and a downloadable link of the STL file:

 <br><br>
 I used the SRM -20 to mill my design out of a block of wax. I used the 1/16 end mill because some of the spaces between the books were too small to be registered by the 1/8 end mill. 
 <br>
 Here is a picture of the parameters I made in the software and a video of the milling:

 I used the wax design to do my casting part of the assignment. I used the casting materials in class. I waited a day until I was sure the casting was completely dry before moving on to creating the mold. 
 <br>
 Here is the casting process and finished piece:

 I wanted to use resin to make my mold so that I can put color and glitter in it so I can use the finished design as a decorative piece in my room. The resin also took a day to completely dry. 
 <br>
 Here is the process and finished mold!!
