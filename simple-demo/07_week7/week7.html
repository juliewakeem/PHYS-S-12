 ### Week 7: Output Devices

 <h1> Piezzo Buzzer</h1>

 <p1>For this weeks assignment, I chose to program the piazzo buzzer because I thought it was cool that a little buzzer can make noise that resembles a melody. I chose to do the melody for the Godfather theme song since it's an iconic song. For my input device, I chose to add a button so that I can control the start and stop of the buzzer instead of the buzzer playing on its own.</p1>

 Here is a picture of the circuit:

 <p1>For the code, I modified the melody part of the buzzer to include the code for the button similar to the one used for the magic flying carpet. Initially, the only delay function used would be just for the pauses in between each note which was only 10% of the whole duration. To avoid this, I used the counter function which keeps in mind the duration of the program and activates the notone function after a certain amount of miliseconds passes. The only downfall to this function was that it sped up the melody and didn't work when changed to remedy this. </p1>
