 ### Week 6: Input Devices

 <h1>Microphone Sensor</h1>

 For the first part of the assignment, I chose to follow the tutorial for the microphone sensor.
 <br>
 <br>
 This is the circuit:

 ![image of embroidery](Week6image1.jpg)

 This is the code used:

 <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    const int sampleWindow = 50; // Sample window width in mS (50 mS = 20Hz)
    unsigned int sample;
   
    void setup() 
    {
       Serial.begin(9600);
    }
   
   
    void loop() 
    {
       unsigned long startMillis= millis();  // Start of sample window
       unsigned int peakToPeak = 0;   // peak-to-peak level
   
       unsigned int signalMax = 0;
       unsigned int signalMin = 1024;
   
       // collect data for 50 mS
       while (millis() - startMillis < sampleWindow)
       {
          sample = analogRead(0);   //reading DC pin from pin A0
          if (sample < 1024)  // toss out spurious readings
          {
             if (sample > signalMax)
             {
                signalMax = sample;  // save just the max levels
             }
             else if (sample < signalMin)
             {
                signalMin = sample;  // save just the min levels
             }
          }
       }
       peakToPeak = signalMax - signalMin;  // max - min = peak-peak amplitude
   
       Serial.println(peakToPeak);
    }

 </code></pre>

 <p1>When gathering data, I made two trials in order to make sure I made no error personally. Each trial was relatively the same with min values at 0 and max values at 20 (this does not include the starting data when the circuit was connected).</p1>
 <br>
 <br>
 This is a picture of the graph created in Spreadsheets with the sensor's data:

 I can control the range of the microphone sensor using my finger to tap the sensor itself which creates sound that it picks up on right away. 

 <table>
    <tr>
        <td>Range</td>
        <td>Input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Less than 10</td>
        <td> Not making sound/Not tapping the sensor</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Greater than 10</td>
        <td> Tapping the sensor</td>
    </tr>
 </table>

 <h1>Self-Made Sensor</h1>

 I decided to use a modified 3D printed finger from last week's assignment to experiment with capacitive sensors in order to understand more about what sensor to use for my final project. 
 <br>
 <br>
 I used copper sheets for my electrodes. Here is the circuit/set up:
 <br>

 <br>
 I used the tx-rx code:

 <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    long result;   //variable for the result of the tx_rx measurement.
int analog_pin = A3;
int tx_pin = 4;

void setup() {
    pinMode(tx_pin, OUTPUT);      //Pin 4 provides the voltage step
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    result = tx_rx();
    Serial.println(result);
}


long tx_rx(){         // Function to execute rx_tx algorithm and return a value
                      // that depends on coupling of two electrodes.
                      // Value returned is a long integer.
  int read_high;
  int read_low;
  int diff;
  long int sum;
  int N_samples = 100;    // Number of samples to take.  Larger number slows it down, but reduces scatter.

  sum = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < N_samples; i++){
   digitalWrite(tx_pin,HIGH);              // Step the voltage high on conductor 1.
   read_high = analogRead(analog_pin);     // Measure response of conductor 2.
   delayMicroseconds(100);                 // Delay to reach steady state.
   digitalWrite(tx_pin,LOW);               // Step the voltage to zero on conductor 1.
   read_low = analogRead(analog_pin);      // Measure response of conductor 2.
   diff = read_high - read_low;            // desired answer is the difference between high and low.
   sum += diff;                            // Sums up N_samples of these measurements.
 }
  return sum;
}                                          // End of tx_rx function.
 </code></pre>
 
 I also made two trials of this and the results were also similar. The min value was 1,384 and the max value 17,626. 
 <br>

 <br>
 I can control the range of this sensor by bending the joint of the finger to change the distance between the copper pieces. 
 <br>
 <table>
    <tr>
        <td>Range</td>
        <td>Input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Less than ~7,000</td>
        <td> Joint is bended backward --> distance between copper pieces is larger </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Greater than ~7,000</td>
        <td> Joint is bended forward --> distance between copper pieces is smaller</td>
    </tr>
 </table>
