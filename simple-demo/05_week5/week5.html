 ### Week 5: 3D Design, Printing, and Scanning

 <h1>Final Project 3D Print Idea</h1>
 <p1>For this week's assignment, we were able to design a component that can be useful towards our final project. I learned from class that if you 3D print something thin enough, it could be flexible despite the material. For my final project, I need to create a bone structure for the glove that is flexible but firm at the same time. I decided to try making a 3D printed bone structure that is modeled after my hand.</p1>

 Here is a picture of the first design:

 <p2>After transfering the file to the Prusa Slicer software, it turned out that the design looked too thick and wouldn't give the desired flexibility. Therefore, I decided to create a different design. This time, with some help, I thought it would be easier to individually design each finger for the bone structure instead of the whole hand.</p2> 

 Here is the design for the finger. This includes the knuckle and finger joints. I decided to make the connecting pieces with different depth to test which size is the best in creating the flexible aspect. The sizes of thickness are 3mm, 2mm, and 1mm
