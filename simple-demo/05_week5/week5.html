 ### Week 5: 3D Design, Printing, and Scanning

 <h1>Final Project 3D Print Idea</h1>
 <p1>For this week's assignment, we were able to design a component that can be useful towards our final project. I learned from class that if you 3D print something thin enough, it could be flexible despite the material. For my final project, I need to create a bone structure for the glove that is flexible but firm at the same time. I decided to try making a 3D printed bone structure that is modeled after my hand.</p1>

 Here is a picture of the first design:

 <p2>After transfering the file to the Prusa Slicer software, it turned out that the design looked too thick and wouldn't give the desired flexibility. Therefore, I decided to create a different design. This time, with some help, I thought it would be easier to individually design each finger for the bone structure instead of the whole hand.</p2> 

 Here is the design for the finger. This includes the knuckle and finger joints. I decided to make the connecting pieces with different depth to test which size is the best in creating the flexible aspect. The sizes of thickness are 3mm, 2mm, and 1mm

 Here is a picture of the Prusa Slicer file and the first layer of the 3D print.

 Here is the result of the 3D print.

 <p3>From this, I learned that the 1mm thickness was the most flexible and even better if the pieces were longer. In the future, I think I would like to experiment more with this and see if I can make the design better to be more flexible yet functional. </p3>
