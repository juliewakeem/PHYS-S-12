 ### Week 2: Fusion 360 and Laser Cutter

<h1>Fusion 360 Tutorial</h1>
<p1>For this week's assignment we needed to get familiar with the software Fusion 360. The first thing I did was follow one of the tutorials given to us. In this tutorial, the person showed how different controls worked as well as how we can produce different shapes in the program.</p1>


The first part was creating lines, angles, and arcs.

The next part was creating circles and tangent lines.

The last part was creating an ellipse.

<h2>Fusion 360 Household Items</h2>

<p2>The first household item that I modeled was a coffee cup holder. I was thinking that I should start relatively easy so that I can understand the controls better. I used the caliphers in the lab to take in the thickness of the object as well as the length and the width. The width and length of the coffee cup holder was about 100.44 mm. The thickness was 4.76 mm.</p2>

First, I created the shape of the coffee cup holder which was a square.

Then, I extruded the object and put in the thickness. I noticed that the corners of the coffee cup holder was a little more round than straight edged so I applied a fillet of 1 to mimic the curved corners.

Lastly, I applied the fillet to all the corners and the model was done.
