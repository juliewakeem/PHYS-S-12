 ### Week 2: Fusion 360 and Laser Cutter

<h1>Fusion 360 Tutorial</h1>
<p1>For this week's assignment we needed to get familiar with the software Fusion 360. The first thing I did was follow one of the tutorials given to us. In this tutorial, the person showed how different controls worked as well as how we can produce different shapes in the program.</p1>


The first part was creating lines, angles, and arcs.

The next part was creating circles and tangent lines.

The last part was creating an ellipse.

<h2>Fusion 360 Household Items: Coffee Cup Holder and Candle</h2>

<p2>The first household item that I modeled was a coffee cup holder. I was thinking that I should start relatively easy so that I can understand the controls better. I used the caliphers in the lab to take in the thickness of the object as well as the length and the width. The width and length of the coffee cup holder was about 100.44 mm. The thickness was 4.76 mm.</p2>

First, I created the shape of the coffee cup holder which was a square.

Then, I extruded the object and put in the thickness. I noticed that the corners of the coffee cup holder was a little more round than straight edged so I applied a fillet of 1 to mimic the curved corners.

Lastly, I applied the fillet to all the corners and the model was done.

<p3>The second household item that I modeled was a candle. This candle is in an octogon shape. I modled the candle itself and the since it had a wooden cap, I modeled that as well. With a calipher, the candle itself measured about 90 mm in width and in length. The thickness is about 112 mm not including the cap. The cap had the same octogon shape so the width and length is the same as the candle. The thickness of the cap is about 8 mm.</p3>

I started the model by measuring each side which was about 37 mm and the angle about 135 degrees so that I can create the octogon shape. I cmirrored this for the cap.

After that, I modified the parameters by making a thickness for the candle itself and making another one for the cap. Then, I extruded the model and put in the thickness for each part.

<h3>Pyramid Press Fit Kit</h3>

<p4>For the press fit kit assignment, I decided to make a pyramid. I am egyptian so its a big part of my identity. Whenever someone thinks of Egypt, they think of the Great Pyramids of Giza. Therefore, I decided to make a pyramid and I thought it would be fun seeing the result.</p4>

My first step was to create a drawing of what I thought the pieces would look like in order to get an idea of what to model on Fusion 360.

I decided to make the measurements of the square be 80 mm by 80 mm. And the height be 60 mm in order to create a perfect right triangle. The triangle has a base of 80 mm, a height of 60 mm, and a slanted height of 100 mm. These measurements made the length of the press fit pieces be about 16 mm.

Once I though the model was as accurate as I wanted it to be, I moved my file to the laser cutter and got the pieces.

This is how they looked once the pieces were done.

<p5>As soon as I started trying to put the pieces together, I noticed two problems. The first was that the pieces were too loose and didn't hold when put together. The other problem was that when the triangle pieces were put against each other, the corners didn't fit right. To fix the first problem, I adjusted the kerf. To fix the second problem I came up with another design for the triangle pieces to try to fit the corners.</p5>

<p6>After doing another round of laser cutter, the same problems remained. The corner pieces of the triangles were better but still on top of each other. The pieces in general were still too loose. After some help, I realized that it would be easier to have a triangle piece that had one side as a regular edge piece but the other side have a slightly cut off angle. This would make it so the pieces are more aligned and only have one laser cut side be visible when it is all put together. It would almost be a switch off at the corners. To make the pieces be less loose. I decide to make only the square be adjusted to the kerf while the triangle pieces stay as originally measured. This would sort of balance out and make the pieces more press fit.</p6>

Here is a close up of the triangle piece adjustment.

The result of the changes allowed the corners to be fit just right as well as the pyramid as a whole

Finally, I noticed that the top where the triangles meet wasn't quite right. I decided to create a square to make the pyramid top more press fit. The square has inside dimensions of 19 mm by 19 mm, the outside dimensions are 25 mm by 25 mm.

Here is the final result of the pyramid.
