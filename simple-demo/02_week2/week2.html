 ### Week 2: Fusion 360 and Laser Cutter

<h1>Fusion 360 Tutorial</h1>
<p1>For this week's assignment we needed to get familiar with the software Fusion 360. The first thing I did was follow one of the tutorials given to us. In this tutorial, the person showed how different controls worked as well as how we can produce different shapes in the program.</p1>

<p2>The first part was creating lines, angles, and arcs.</p2>
